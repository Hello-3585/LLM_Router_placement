### Default Parameter Values  

| **Parameter**               | **Default Value**             |  
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|  
| **X User Distribution**     | Uniform                      |  
| **Y User Distribution**     | Uniform                      |  
| **Height**                  | \( 3.0 \, \text{m} \)        |  
| **Path Loss Parameter \( K \)** | \( 0.005 \, \text{dB} \)  |  
| **Path Loss Exponent \( \alpha \)** | \( 3.0 \)             |  
| **Device Name**             | Cisco ASR-900                |  
| **User Equipment Height**   | \( 1.0 \, \text{m} \)        |

### Parameter Details  

1. **User Distribution**:  
   - **Along the Edge**: Refers to **exponential distribution along the X-axis** and **uniform distribution along the Y-axis**. This is typical for hospital or similar layouts.  
   - **Center**: Refers to **Gaussian distribution along both the X and Y axes**, commonly seen in banquet halls or event spaces.  
   - **Spread Evenly**: Refers to **uniform distribution along both the X and Y axes**, typical for office environments.  
   - **Along One Corner**: Refers to **exponential distribution along both the X and Y axes**, representing scenarios with user density concentrated in one corner.  
   - **Along Opposite Corners**: Refers to **bi-exponential distribution along both the X and Y axes**, with user density peaks at two opposite corners of the environment.  
   - **Along Adjacent Corners**: Refers to **exponential distribution along the X-axis** and **bi-exponential distribution along the Y-axis**, representing a concentration of users in two adjacent corners.  

2. **Height**:  
   - Default height of the indoor space is \( 3.0 \, \text{m} \), typical of residential or small office environments.  

3. **Path Loss Parameters**:  
   - \( K \) (Path Loss Constant): \( 0.005 \, \text{dB} \), minimal constant attenuation for short distances.  
   - \( \alpha \) (Path Loss Exponent): \( 3.0 \), suitable for moderately obstructed indoor environments.  

4. **Device Name**:  
   - The default Access Point (AP) or router is the **Cisco ASR-900**, a reliable and commonly used device for indoor setups.  

5. **User Equipment Height**:  
   - Height of user devices (e.g., phones, laptops) is assumed to be \( 1.0 \, \text{m} \), representing hand-held or table-level usage.

### Notes for Use  

- The above values serve as **baseline defaults** and may be adjusted based on specific environmental characteristics or device configurations.  
- For environments other than **House**, additional tuning of parameters like \( K \), \( \alpha \), and distribution types may be necessary.
