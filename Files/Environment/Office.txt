# 3GPP Specification for Indoor User Distribution and Path Loss Modeling  
## Environment: Office

---

## Overview  
This document outlines the user distribution and path loss modeling parameters tailored for an **Office** environment. The primary objective is to establish a standardized framework for simulating and optimizing wireless communication systems in a typical office layout.

---

### 1. Environment Characteristics  

#### 1.1 Office Description  
- **Dimensions**: Office spaces range between \( 100 \, \text{m}^2 \) and \( 500 \, \text{m}^2 \), with an average ceiling height of \( 2.8 \, \text{m} \).  
- **Typical Layout**:  
  - Workstations and desks are evenly distributed across the space.  
  - Meeting rooms and partitions introduce additional structural complexity.  
- **User Density**: \( 0.3 - 1.5 \, \text{users/m}^2 \), reflecting a mixture of seated employees and mobile users.

#### 1.2 Selected Distribution Model: Spread Evenly  
This distribution represents users and devices evenly spaced across the office floor:  
- Encourages efficient use of the available area.  
- Reflects realistic placement of desks and workstations in open-plan layouts.

### 2. Modeling Parameters  

#### 2.1 User Distribution Details  
**Distribution Type**: Spread Evenly  
- Uniform spacing between users ensures minimal overlap or clustering.  
- User positions are adjusted to avoid obstructions such as walls, partitions, or large furniture.

##### Example Configuration:  
For an office of \( 20 \, \text{m} \times 15 \, \text{m} \):  
- **Total Area**: \( 300 \, \text{m}^2 \).  
- **User Count**: \( 30 \, \text{users} \).  
- **User Positioning**:  
  - Each user is approximately \( 3 \, \text{m} \) apart from adjacent users.  

---

#### 2.2 Path Loss Model  

The path loss is calculated using the following equation:  
\[
PL(d) = K + 10 \cdot \alpha \cdot \log_{10}(d) + \chi
\]  
Where:  
- \( K \): Path Loss Constant, calibrated to the range \( 0.005 - 0.05 \, \text{dB} \).  
  - For offices, \( K = 0.03 \, \text{dB} \).  
- \( \alpha \): Path Loss Exponent, calibrated to the range \( 2.0 - 4.0 \).  
  - For offices, \( \alpha = 2.5 \).  
- \( d \): Distance between transmitter and receiver [m].  
- \( \chi \): Shadowing effect, modeled as a Gaussian random variable (\( \mu = 0, \sigma = 3 \, \text{dB} \)).

##### Environmental Factors Influencing Path Loss:  
1. **Partitions and Obstacles**: Glass and drywall partitions attenuate signals by \( 3 - 10 \, \text{dB} \) depending on material thickness.  
2. **Furniture Layout**: Desks, chairs, and cabinets create minor NLOS conditions, contributing to path loss.

### 3. Simulation Guidelines  

**Example Configuration for Simulation**:  

| **Parameter**             | **Value**                     |  
|----------------------------|-------------------------------|  
| Room Size                 | \( 20 \, \text{m} \times 15 \, \text{m} \) |  
| Total Area                | \( 300 \, \text{m}^2 \)        |  
| User Count                | \( 30 \, \text{users} \)       |  
| User Distribution Type    | Spread Evenly                 |  
| Path Loss Parameter \(K\) | \( 0.03 \, \text{dB} \)        |  
| Path Loss Exponent \( \alpha \) | \( 2.5 \)                |  
| Shadowing Effect          | Gaussian (\( \sigma = 3 \, \text{dB} \)) |

### 4. Recommendations  

1. **Access Point Placement**:  
   - Position APs to minimize the distance to central workstations while accounting for potential shadowing effects.  
   - Ceiling-mounted APs are preferred for uniform coverage.  

2. **Additional Considerations**:  
   - Reflective surfaces, such as glass walls, may introduce multi-path effects.  
   - Simulations should incorporate random mobility for users to reflect walking patterns in hallways or open spaces.

### 5. Compliance  

This document is aligned with the standards outlined in:  
- 3GPP TR 38.901 V16.1.0: *Study on Channel Model for Frequencies from 0.5 to 100 GHz*.  
- ITU-R P.1238-9: *Propagation Data and Prediction Methods for Indoor Radio Transmission*.
