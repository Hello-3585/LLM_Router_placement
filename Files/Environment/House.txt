## 3. Terminology and Abbreviations
**K**: Path Loss Parameter representing the free space path loss constant, with values between \( 0.005 \, \text{dB} \) and \( 0.05 \, \text{dB} \).  
**α (alpha)**: Path Loss Exponent defining the rate of signal attenuation over distance, with values between \( 2.0 \) and \( 4.0 \).  
**User Distribution (UD)**: Spatial arrangement of user devices in the environment.  

---

## 4. General Description
The **House** environment is characterized by:
- **Dimensions**: Smaller, enclosed spaces typically ranging from 100m² to 300m² with ceiling heights of 2.5m to 3m.  
- **User Density**: Between 0.5 and 2 users per 10m², depending on the number of residents and devices.  
- **User Distribution Type**: **Gaussian Distribution**, reflecting a natural concentration of user activity near the center of the house.

## 5. Modeling Parameters

### 5.1 User Distribution
#### 5.1.1 Rationale for Gaussian Distribution
The **Gaussian Distribution** is selected based on the typical user behavior in a house:
- User activity and devices are often concentrated near the living room or central area of the house.  
- This distribution aligns with common household layouts where primary access points and user interactions are centralized.  

#### 5.1.2 Mathematical Representation
The spatial probability density function for the Gaussian Distribution is defined as:
\[
P(x, y) = \frac{1}{2 \pi \sigma_x \sigma_y} \exp\left(-\frac{(x - \mu_x)^2}{2\sigma_x^2} - \frac{(y - \mu_y)^2}{2\sigma_y^2}\right)
\]
Where:
- \( \mu_x, \mu_y \): Mean (center of the distribution, usually the house's center).  
- \( \sigma_x, \sigma_y \): Standard deviations along the x and y axes, representing spread.  

#### 5.1.3 Example Configuration
For a house with dimensions \( 15 \, \text{m} \times 10 \, \text{m} \):
- **Center** (\( \mu_x, \mu_y \)): \( (7.5 \, \text{m}, 5 \, \text{m}) \).  
- **Standard Deviation**: \( \sigma_x = 3 \, \text{m}, \sigma_y = 2 \, \text{m} \).  

---

### 5.2 Path Loss Model
The path loss is defined using the following equation:
\[
PL(d) = K + 10 \cdot \alpha \cdot \log_{10}(d) + \chi
\]
Where:
- \( K \): Path Loss Parameter [dB], calibrated to the range \( 0.005 - 0.05 \, \text{dB} \).  
  - Typical value for a house: \( K = 0.02 \, \text{dB} \).  
- \( \alpha \): Path Loss Exponent, calibrated to the range \( 2.0 - 4.0 \).  
  - Typical value for a house: \( \alpha = 2.8 \, \text{(NLOS)} \).  
- \( d \): Distance between transmitter and receiver [m].  
- \( \chi \): Shadowing effect, modeled as a zero-mean Gaussian random variable with variance \( \sigma^2 \).  

---

### 5.3 Environmental Factors
1. **Obstacles and Layout**:  
   - Walls, furniture, and household appliances create NLOS conditions and multi-path effects.  
   - Path loss increases by 5-10 dB due to internal walls.  
2. **Ceiling Height**:  
   - Lower ceilings (2.5-3m) affect signal propagation by limiting vertical coverage.

| **Parameter**           | **Value**                       |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Room Size                | \( 15 \, \text{m} \times 10 \, \text{m} \) |
| Room Area (\( A \))       | \( 150 \, \text{m}^2 \)         |
| User Density             | 1.0 users/m² (15 users total)  |
| Distribution Type        | Gaussian                       |
| Path Loss Parameter \(K\) | \( 0.02 \, \text{dB} \)        |
| Path Loss Exponent \(α\)  | \( 2.8 \, \text{(NLOS)} \)      |
| Shadowing Effect         | Gaussian (\( \mu=0, \sigma=2 \, \text{dB} \)) |

## 7. Additional Notes
1. The Gaussian Distribution ensures accurate modeling of user concentrations around central living spaces.  
2. Simulations should account for household layouts, such as partitioned rooms, open kitchens, and corridors, for realistic propagation scenarios.  
3. Multi-path effects due to reflective surfaces (e.g., mirrors, windows) should be included in advanced configurations.

---

## 8. Compliance
All simulations conducted under this specification must adhere to the parameter definitions and modeling frameworks outlined in Sections 4 and 5.

Sample plots for Gaussian user distributions in a house are available in Appendix C of the reference document 3GPP TR 38.901 V16.1.0.
