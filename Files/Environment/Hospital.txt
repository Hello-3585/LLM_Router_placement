# 3GPP Specification: Indoor User Distribution and Path Loss Model for "Hospital" Environment

## 1. Scope
This specification defines the user distribution and path loss modeling parameters for simulations conducted in a **Hospital** environment. The document provides a standardized framework for use in performance evaluation, system optimization, and scenario analysis in indoor networks.

## 3. Terminology and Abbreviations
**K**: Path Loss Parameter representing the free space path loss constant, with values between \( 0.005 \, \text{dB} \) and \( 0.05 \, \text{dB} \).  
**α (alpha)**: Path Loss Exponent defining the rate of signal attenuation over distance, with values between \( 2.0 \) and \( 4.0 \).  
**User Distribution (UD)**: Spatial arrangement of user devices in the environment.  

---

## 4. General Description
The **Hospital** environment is characterized by:
- **Dimensions**: Medium to large spaces, typically ranging from 200m² to 1000m², with ceiling heights of 3m to 4m.  
- **User Density**: Between 0.2 and 1 users per 10m², depending on the ward type and number of devices per bed.  
- **User Distribution Type**: **Along the Edge**, reflecting typical bed placements along walls or partitions in hospital wards.

## 5. Modeling Parameters

### 5.1 User Distribution
#### 5.1.1 Rationale for Along the Edge Distribution
The **Along the Edge** distribution is selected based on the structural layout and user behavior in hospitals:
- Beds and associated devices (e.g., monitors, IV pumps) are typically arranged along walls or edges of the ward to optimize space and access.  
- This layout minimizes obstructions in the central areas, allowing for staff movement and equipment operation.

#### 5.1.2 Mathematical Representation
The spatial arrangement for **Along the Edge Distribution** can be described as:
- Users are concentrated along the perimeter of the room, forming continuous or discrete clusters.  
- The density of users along the edges is higher than in the central areas.  

#### 5.1.3 Example Configuration
For a hospital ward with dimensions \( 20 \, \text{m} \times 10 \, \text{m} \):
- Beds are placed along all four walls, with approximately 5 beds per wall.
- User density is highest within 1m of the walls.

### 5.2 Path Loss Model
The path loss is defined using the following equation:
\[
PL(d) = K + 10 \cdot \alpha \cdot \log_{10}(d) + \chi
\]
Where:
- \( K \): Path Loss Parameter [dB], calibrated to the range \( 0.005 - 0.05 \, \text{dB} \).  
  - Typical value for a hospital: \( K = 0.015 \, \text{dB} \).  
- \( \alpha \): Path Loss Exponent, calibrated to the range \( 2.0 - 4.0 \).  
  - Typical value for a hospital: \( \alpha = 3.0 \, \text{(NLOS)} \).  
- \( d \): Distance between transmitter and receiver [m].  
- \( \chi \): Shadowing effect, modeled as a zero-mean Gaussian random variable with variance \( \sigma^2 \).  

---

### 5.3 Environmental Factors
1. **Obstacles and Layout**:  
   - Hospital beds, partitions, and medical equipment create NLOS conditions and multi-path effects.  
   - Path loss increases by 6-12 dB due to partitions and reflective surfaces.  
2. **Ceiling Height**:  
   - Standard hospital ceilings (3-4m) ensure good vertical coverage for ceiling-mounted access points.

## 6. Example Simulation Configuration
| **Parameter**           | **Value**                       |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Room Size                | \( 20 \, \text{m} \times 10 \, \text{m} \) |
| Room Area (\( A \))       | \( 200 \, \text{m}^2 \)         |
| User Density             | 0.5 users/m² (10 beds along walls) |
| Distribution Type        | Along the Edge                 |
| Path Loss Parameter \(K\) | \( 0.015 \, \text{dB} \)       |
| Path Loss Exponent \(α\)  | \( 3.0 \, \text{(NLOS)} \)      |
| Shadowing Effect         | Gaussian (\( \mu=0, \sigma=3 \, \text{dB} \)) |

## 7. Additional Notes
1. The **Along the Edge** distribution ensures realistic modeling of bed placements in hospital wards.  
2. Simulations should account for partitions, curtains, and other medical infrastructure, which significantly influence signal propagation.  
3. Advanced configurations may consider dynamic user movements for scenarios involving mobile medical equipment or roaming staff.  

---

## 8. Compliance
All simulations conducted under this specification must adhere to the parameter definitions and modeling frameworks outlined in Sections 4 and 5.
