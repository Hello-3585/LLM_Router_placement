# 3GPP Specification: Indoor User Distribution and Path Loss Model for "Warehouse" Environment

## 1. Scope
This specification defines the user distribution and path loss modeling parameters for simulations conducted in a **Warehouse** environment. The document provides a standardized framework for use in performance evaluation, system optimization, and scenario analysis in indoor networks.

---

## 2. References
The following documents and references are applicable to this specification:
- 3GPP TR 38.901 V16.1.0: *Study on Channel Model for Frequencies from 0.5 to 100 GHz*
- 3GPP TS 36.300 V16.6.0: *LTE Architecture Description*
- ITU-R P.1238-9: *Propagation Data and Prediction Methods for Indoor Radio Transmission*

## 3. Terminology and Abbreviations
**K**: Path Loss Parameter representing the free space path loss constant, with values between \( 0.005 \, \text{dB} \) and \( 0.05 \, \text{dB} \).  
**α (alpha)**: Path Loss Exponent defining the rate of signal attenuation over distance, with values between \( 2.0 \) and \( 4.0 \).  
**User Distribution (UD)**: Spatial arrangement of user devices in the environment.  

---

## 4. General Description
The **Warehouse** environment is characterized by:
- **Dimensions**: Large open spaces, typically ranging from 500m² to 5000m² with high ceilings (5-12m).  
- **User Density**: Between 0.1 and 5 users per 100m².  
- **User Distribution Type**: **Uniform Distribution**, reflecting evenly spaced users or devices, such as robots, sensors, or workers across the space.

---

## 5. Modeling Parameters

### 5.1 User Distribution
#### 5.1.1 Rationale for Uniform Distribution
The **Uniform Distribution** is selected for its alignment with the operational layout of a warehouse:
- Users or devices (e.g., robots, sensors, workers) are often spaced evenly to cover the warehouse efficiently.
- This distribution supports simulations for optimizing load balancing and coverage in large, open areas.

#### 5.1.2 Mathematical Representation
The spatial probability density function for the Uniform Distribution is defined as:
\[
P(x, y) =
\begin{cases} 
\frac{1}{A} & \text{if } (x, y) \in \text{Room Area}, \\
0 & \text{otherwise,}
\end{cases}
\]
Where:
- \( A = \text{Room Area} = \text{Width} \times \text{Length} \)
- \( P(x, y) \): Probability density function, constant across the room area.

#### 5.1.3 Example Configuration
For a warehouse with dimensions \( 50 \, \text{m} \times 30 \, \text{m} \):
- **Room Area (\( A \))**: \( 1500 \, \text{m}^2 \)
- **User Density**: \( 0.5 \, \text{users/m}^2 \) (approx. 75 users/devices distributed uniformly).

### 5.2 Path Loss Model
The path loss is defined using the following equation:
\[
PL(d) = K + 10 \cdot \alpha \cdot \log_{10}(d) + \chi
\]
Where:
- \( K \): Path Loss Parameter [dB], calibrated to the range \( 0.005 - 0.05 \, \text{dB} \).  
  - Typical value for a warehouse: \( K = 0.03 \, \text{dB} \).  
- \( \alpha \): Path Loss Exponent, calibrated to the range \( 2.0 - 4.0 \).  
  - Typical value for a warehouse: \( \alpha = 3.2 \, \text{(NLOS)} \).  
- \( d \): Distance between transmitter and receiver [m].  
- \( \chi \): Shadowing effect, modeled as a zero-mean Gaussian random variable with variance \( \sigma^2 \).  

---

### 5.3 Environmental Factors
1. **Obstacles and Layout**:  
   - Metal racks, shelves, and equipment create NLOS conditions and multi-path effects.  
   - Path loss increases by 8-15 dB due to metal obstructions.  
2. **Ceiling Height**:  
   - Taller ceilings (10-12m) may affect signal propagation due to increased distance from access points.

## 6. Example Simulation Configuration
| **Parameter**           | **Value**                       |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Room Size                | \( 50 \, \text{m} \times 30 \, \text{m} \) |
| Room Area (\( A \))       | \( 1500 \, \text{m}^2 \)        |
| User Density             | 0.5 users/m² (75 users total)  |
| Distribution Type        | Uniform                        |
| Path Loss Parameter \(K\) | \( 0.03 \, \text{dB} \)        |
| Path Loss Exponent \(α\)  | \( 3.2 \, \text{(NLOS)} \)      |
| Shadowing Effect         | Gaussian (\( \mu=0, \sigma=3 \, \text{dB} \)) |

## 7. Additional Notes
1. The Uniform Distribution ensures optimal coverage for simulations aimed at evaluating overall system performance in a warehouse.  
2. Simulations should account for metal surfaces and reflective interference to increase model fidelity.  
3. Large aisles and varying shelf heights can significantly alter propagation and should be included in advanced scenarios.  

---

## 8. Compliance
All simulations conducted under this specification must adhere to the parameter definitions and modeling frameworks outlined in Sections 4 and 5.

## Annex A: Distribution Visualizations
Sample plots for uniform user distributions in a warehouse are available in Appendix B of the reference document 3GPP TR 38.901 V16.1.0.
